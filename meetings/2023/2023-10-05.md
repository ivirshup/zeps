# 2023-10-05

**Attending:** Sanket Verma (SV), Josh Moore (JM), Thomas Nicholas (TN), Jonathan Striebel (JS), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS)

## TL;DR:

In this meeting, attendees shared their favorite books as a fun introduction. The discussions revolved around various GitHub issues and pull requests, including considerations for making a store less explicit, clarifying certain points, and addressing implementation details. Jeremy Maitin-Shepard highlighted the successful 100% V3 implementation in Neuroglancer and Tensorstore, while Thomas Nicholas expressed interest in performance improvements, particularly regarding variable chunking in Zarr-Python. Plans to finalize ZEP0003 for voting were also mentioned.
