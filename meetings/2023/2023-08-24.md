# 2023-08-24

**Attending:** Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Sanket Verma (SV), Josh Moore (JM)

## TL;DR:

The meeting focused on ZEP0004 preliminary work for review and highlighted open pull requests addressing various aspects of the Zarr specifications. Discussions revolved around the proposal for a lightweight ZEP process specifically designed for adding codecs and data types, with considerations for fast-tracking certain additions, especially those crucial for specific domains. Additionally, updates on the Tensorstore implementation were provided, indicating the nearing completion of V3 and sharding implementations with ongoing bug fixes.

**Updates:**

- ZEP0004 preliminary work for review: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/262>
- Open PRs:
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/256>
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/257>
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/261>
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/263>

**Meeting minutes:**

- JMS: Lightweight ZEP process for adding codecs and datatypes
    - JM: How do you think it should look like?
    - JMS: Opening a PR and get the votes from ZIC and ZSC could be it
    - SV: Minimilastic ZEP for adding codec and data types
    - JM: The voting process keep going-on for codecs and data types without hinderance from the bigger ZEPs
    - JMS: Can work on a lightweight ZEP template for codec and dtype
    - JM: Certain datatypes addition may be possible blocks for some domains - having a fast-track ZEPs would help that
    - JMS: Would like to work on dtypes for ML use-cases
- SV: Tensorstore implementation
    - JMS: V3 and Sharding implementation almost complete - working on some bugs - will be finalising soon!
