**Attending:** Dennis Heimbigner (DH), Sanket Verma (SV), Josh Moore (JM), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS)

## TL;DR:

The meeting discussed the release of Zarr-Python 2.18.0, a new blog post by Joe Hamman, and updates on the sharding support in the R implementation. They also covered the implementation of manifest storage transformers, standardizing URLs for Zarr, and the removal of implicit groups in Zarr-Python V3.

**Updates:**

**Meeting Minutes:**

- Zarr-Python 2.18.0 out now: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/releases/tag/v2.18.0>
    - One of the last few releases for Zarr Spec 2 - if there's anything you want to get in, please reply/tag us in the PRs/issues
- New blog post by Joe Hamman: <https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-python-v3-update/>
- Zarr-Python developers meeting new schedule - check here: <https://zarr.dev/community-calls/>
- Lachlan Deakin added support for sharding in his R implementation: <https://github.com/LDeakin/zarrs/releases/tag/v0.13.1>

**Open agenda (add here üëáüèª):**

- JM: In sharding you can recurse and browse through the chunks - somthing like _chunks([x, y])_
    - DH: Treating sub-chunks as regular chunks - like what we decided during the storage transformers proposal - 
        - _DH understands this proposal better and favours it_
    - The relevant issue: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/220>
    - DH: Time to gets hands dirty with the implementation and figure out any problems we have
    - JMS: Using storage transformers and codecs in Neuroglancer to achieve sharding
    - DH: 
- SV: Manifest storage transformers - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/287> - defines and implements on top of the storage transformer in V3 core spec - discussion üëáüèª
    - JMS: Good to define the `JSON` and add other formats later on
    - DH: FSSPEC interprets the URL in Kerchunk
    - DH: Having complete key values in URL would help in the long run - DAP made a mistake earlier and we fixed it - having a complete URL is a better option and you can replace the contents within it later on
    - JM: Having a complete URL in manifest storage transformer for Zarr would help us but there's a question of backward compatibility
    - JMS: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zeps/pull/48/> standardise the URL
    - DH: URL spec defines the format and correct way of defninig a URL - if you consider things other than FSSPEC you should have a more standardised URL
    - DH: Conforming to the [URL Spec](https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt) should be avoided actively
    - JM: Having URL defined in the storage transformed would help - currently not defined
- Fix typo - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/294> - **MERGED**
- Updated Zarr-Specs license to CC-BY-4.0 - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/295>
- Implicit groups removed in Zarr-Python V3 via <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1827>
    - Corresponding PR in Zarr-Specs - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/292>
