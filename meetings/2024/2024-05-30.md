# 2024-05-30

**Attending:** Sanket Verma (SV) and Davis Bennett (DB)

## TL;DR:

**Updates:**

- Zarr + NASA applications survey: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/discussions/1930>
- Zarr-Python 2.18.1 and 2.18.2 were released in the last 2 weeks - includes a couple of minor bugs
- Latest update: ZP V3.0 alpha aimed to release this week
- New blog post coming soon in collaboration with NASA POWER project - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/blog/pull/57>

**Meeting Minutes:**

- DB: Discussion on - <https://ossci.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/423692-Zarr/topic/data.20model.20for.20codecs>
    - DB: <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/blob/v3/src/zarr/metadata.py#L157> - This is inconsistent with the current design
    - Also doesn't conforms with the spec
    - The array metadata should be immutable but `codec = CodecPipeline` makes it mutable
- Implicit groups removed in Zarr-Python V3 via <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python/pull/1827>
    - Corresponding PR in Zarr-Specs - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/292>
    - SV: There's a informal consensus - we should go ahead with this PR
