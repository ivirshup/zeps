# 2024-03-07

**Attending:** Sanket Verma (SV), Ward Fisher (WF), Davis Bennett (DB), Josh Moore (JM), Thomas Nicholas (TN), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS)

## TL;DR:

The meeting discussed enhancing Zarr store browsing, pushing Kerchunk functionality into Zarr, and the potential for a chunk manifest as a ZEP. Additionally, the group explored ideas for revising ZEP0, creating a Zarr specification IETF standard, and shared updates on upcoming Zarr HTTP Extension and SEA conference events.

**Updates:**

- Zarr HTTP Extension Meeting next week
    - Check here: <https://zarr.dev/community-calls>
- TN: <https://hackmd.io/t9Myqt0HR7O0nq6wiHWCDA?view>
    - Had a conversation with folks over at Development Seed, NASA, Earthmover

**Meeting Minutes:**

- TN: Jed wants to have nice ways to browse the Zarr stores - they have nice ways to browse `.tiff` files already
    - Wants to propose an extension to add more information in the metadata
    - The end result would look more like a Xarray HTML wrapper
- TN: <https://hackmd.io/t9Myqt0HR7O0nq6wiHWCDA?view>
    - Had a conversation with folks over at Development Seed, NASA, Earthmover
    - DB: Pushing Kerchunk functionality into Zarr stores
    - DB: Whether the feature could be file format agnostic?
    - TN: Argues that it should be a ZEP - and can be read every Zarr implementation
    - JM: Having same thing implemented in FSSPEC 
    - DB: Would ZEP 
    - WF: HDF5 group may be open to a conversation
    - SV: <https://zarr.dev/zeps/meetings/2023/2023-08-10.html> might have some useful information
    - TN: _recaps the conversation for JMS_
    - TN: Should concatenation be a part of the current ZEP?
    - DB: Any reason you don't want to concatenate HDF5 and other file formats?
    - TN: Chunk manifest would point inside the arrays - chunk manifest could let you create a Zarr store over other formats as well
    - DB: This would make Zarr as an API/access pattern
    - TN: Can be created and tested fairly separate to Zarr - personally think chunk manifest is neat feature - implementation can support/not support it
    - DB: Array mutation can break the concatenation - having guidelines for archival arrays would help
    - TN: Currently we're thinking about read-only case
    - TN: Virtualisation in Kerchunk is a spotlight feature
    - JMS: Manifest is a good idea and keeping it separate would be a minor difference - needs to align with Kerchunk
- JM: report/ZEP idea (time permitting)
    - <https://w3id.org/ro/crate/>
    - JM: Putting ro-create inside Zarr - or making Zarr specification a IETF standard
    - JM: Would probably go ahead and write a convention in NGFF space
    - <https://fairdo.org/>
    - JM: Have a mechanism for going up/down the hierarchy - useful for the HTTP extension discussions
- Revising ZEP0
    - <https://github.com/zarr-developers/zeps/pull/59> - comments/feedback welcome
    - DB: :+1: 
    - DB: Would be easy to have a single PR for my ZEP
    - JMS: Putting narrative document in PR description
    - JM: Weird for commenting on the PR description and for the public visibility
    - JMS: Rationale can be put down as a footnote
    - JMS: Having numeric numbering is something Python follows
    - JMS: The actual specification change can also serve as a ZEP narrative
    - SV: We can pick out certain sections out of the ZEP narrative document
    - JMS: Having a PR template similar to ZEP's narrative could also help us
- WF: <https://sea.ucar.edu/conference/2024>
    - In-person and virtual registrations are available
