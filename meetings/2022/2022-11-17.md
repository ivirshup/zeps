# 2022-11-17

**Attending:** Sanket Verma (SV)...Jonathan Striebel (JS), Ryan Abernathey (RA), Ward Fisher (WF)

## TL;DR: 

Apparently there was a snafu where JS, RA and WF joined a Zoom meeting whereas SV joined another one! 🥲

In the meeting there was the discussion on V3 spec and some of it's missing parts. Also, RA opened a PR on global transformers, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/pull/182).

**Updates:**

- ZEP1 Update, see [here](https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community?at=6374fae6f9491f62c9b7ea61)
    - Check out the ZEP1 GH Project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/zarr-developers/projects/2/views/2); maintained by Jonathan Striebel

**Meeting minutes:**

Same as TL;DR. 👆🏻
