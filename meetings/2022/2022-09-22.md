# 2022-09-22

**Attending:** Ward Fisher (WF), Josh Moore (JM), Ryan Abernathey (RA), Jeremy Maitin-Shepard (JMS), Dennis Heimbigner (DH)

## TL;DR

Consolidate metadata needs an extension for V3, which might result in a new ZEP. Next, JMS shared a document titled ‘Optionally-cooperative distributed b-tree for Tensorstore’. The participants discussed the document after that. After that, JM initiated the discussion on codecs-registry, which was built by one of the GSoC students this summer. The meeting ended with a discussion on the path to the metadata files.

**Meeting Minutes:**

- Java/NetCDF side:
  - JM: Sanket met people 
  - WF: Unidata should be 3x the staff.
  - JM: perhaps starting with a kerchunk implementation?
  - WF: looking for more community involvement (like netcdf-c had)
- JM: Greg mentioned consolidated metadata needs an extension for V3
- RA: Iceberg issue, also see JMS' proposal
  - [https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/154](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs/issues/154)
- JMS: touches on not needing a file per chunk (like discussed last night)
  - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLfyjtCnfJRr-zcWSxKy-gxgHJHSZvJ2y4C3JEHRwkQ/edit?resourcekey=0-o0JdDnC44cJ0FfT8K6U2pw#heading=h.8g8ih69qb0v](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PLfyjtCnfJRr-zcWSxKy-gxgHJHSZvJ2y4C3JEHRwkQ/edit?resourcekey=0-o0JdDnC44cJ0FfT8K6U2pw#heading=h.8g8ih69qb0v)
  - db format that stores a btree.
  - uniquely: designed to allow distributed writes (s3, etc.) *but* doesn't need a peristent database
    - can also read it in a non-distributed fashion
    - downside: adds quite a bit of added complexity (greatly for binary format)
    - also good where sharding isn't appropriate (e.g. pre-defined shard size which is required for write)
      - e.g. large number of small arrays (where sharding won't help)
  - RA: nice document. comments:
    - focused on big distributed writes, but with iceberg had a different main motivation: more flexibility in mapping keys to chunks. kerchunk-like. virtual concatenate . can you reference random chunks? yes.
      - JMS: btree nodes have references to files (like kerchunk). but datafiles are identified with 128-bit path (not an fsspec URL)
      - RA: different use case, so can have them be optional transformers/extensions
    - RA: really similar to tiledb! why not use it?
      - JMS: tiledb is organized by time not space.
      - JM: need a compaction
      - JMS: and even after that you still have a million files.
    - DH: HDF5? internally it's btrees. (which is responsible for most of its complexity). Are you sure this is the path?
      - JMS: not sure there's an alternative to btrees. used in databases, filesystems, etc.
      - DH: if you don't want some ordered searches, then linear hashes are an alternative
      - JMS: ordered is useful for a lot of use cases. but there wasn't an obvious solution for distributed writes
      - DH: [extendable hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extendible_hashing) is an easier data structure (old paper) works well with disk storage.
    - JMS: think this is more a key-value store (like zip)
      - RA: agreed. Nice that it's possible to experiment like this.
      - RA: can the V3 spec support this experimentation? (right extension points?)
      - RA: trying to do that with Iceberg. Martin suggested "IceChunk".
        - See also: hooty and others. Lots of smart ideas that we can copy.
        - Goal is to provide some level of branching & transactions for/on a Zarr store
        - Allow you to work on your staged area which all get written at once.
        - Branch non-destructively (or rollback)
        - The key is having a "manifest" (they all have some concept of that, even kerchunk)
        - Don't depend on the object stores listing as the source of truth
        - Need storage transformers at the top level, not array. But for JMS' idea array-level might suffice.
        - JMS: wasn't planning on an extension. root metadata would be in the same data store.
        - JM: basically writing DB/filesystem :+1: ZarrFS ;)
      - JMS: planning on mongo? Yeah, or Dynamo. (They store JSON)
        - JSON in S3 isn't ideal.
        - metadata in document store and chunks on disk. Beyond just filesystem. It's a data lake.
        - "meta-store"
    - JMS: regarding versioning, how are you representing the delta?
      - The chunk is the minimal writable unit. (out-of-scope)
      - Every chunk write is a uniquely ID'd (e.g. content addressable). That gets a key. Write that to DB.
      - JMS: expecting the database to provide the versioning?
      - RA: no, just a place for documents. versioning (in iceberg) has a branch or a tag that points to a specific chunk manifest. you can create a new one and point your HEAD at that. only rely on database to atomically change the references. iceberg tracks a number for the transaction.
      - JMS: use kerchunk model? limitation on the number of chunks?
      - RA: chunks are likely in a separate manifest. discussed that another extension with Martin.
      - RA: but can just query a chunk from the database.
      - JMS: 1M chunks in v1. then update to v2. What's the diff? A copy.
      - RA: yeah need to play with it.
      - JMS: when you get to wanting to update just a portion of it, then you get to b-trees :smile:
      - RA: no db guys, trying to keep it hackable.
      - RA: but megabyte kerchunk is already getting :heart: since it's so easy. looking for incremental improvement on _that_. (NASA will be pumping out GRIB forever...)
      - JMS: looking forward to hearing more and exchanging info re: b-trees
      - JMS: see also [https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/dvid) (backed by KV database)
        - JM: sharing layers with them?
        - JMS: complicated by other priorities of the EM team. invite Bill to the Zarr meetings?
        - RA: see [https://lakefs.io/](https://lakefs.io/)
        - JM: API versus format
        - RA: thinking about it more like an API
- JM: briefly codecs-registry
  - [https://zarr.dev/codecs-registry/](https://zarr.dev/codecs-registry/)
  - [https://github.com/zarr-developers/codecs-registry](https://github.com/zarr-developers/codecs-registry)
  - JMS: still want a schema per codec. JM: agreed!
  - JMS: talks about codecs having URLs.
    - would by an annoyance to have difference V2 and V3 identifiers.
    - e.g. just numeric constants in the JSON that are from the C API
    - e.g. shuffle parameter which would be nicer as a string.
    - support integer or string for a while (in order to deprecate)
  - JM: have plans to have code in each languages that checks for an id from the central registry
  - DH: approx. that with nczarr. ncdump lists the actual codecs in the file
    - would be good to have something more sophisticated
    - have the disadvantage of C code and interpreted files
    - 3 repositories on the C side. unidata + irvine + hdf5
    - hdf5 only has names, hdf5-ids and a pointer (which is often out of date)
    - something universal would be nice
    - WF: roping in the HDF5 group would be a heavy lift
  - JMS: **URL interface** :rocket: 
    - DH: :+1: for the REST API
  - WF: NSF/CSSI solicitation has opened
    - [https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific-innovation-cssi](https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific-innovation-cssi)
    - perhaps something here
    - WF: planning on getting to [https://www.egu23.eu/](https://www.egu23.eu/)
    - tweet something from zarr_dev to see if there is interest :question: 
    - could collaborate something re: nc/zarr
- JMS: don't have clear resolution on the paths to the metadata files
  - JM: re-capped the previous discussion and think it's still good.
  - JMS: some details around the root array (the named files, etc.)
  - JMS: consolidated metadata? duplicated?
    - JM: would make it possible to have everything in the top-level
    - JMS: pointers in the subdirectories? bit annoying.
  - JMS: with iceberg & co. you likely don't need a consolidated metadata
  - JM: so you'd push it to the store level?
  - JMS: possibly, but not that simple
  - JMS: there are cases where you need path separation anyway (Zips)
  - JMS: so could see using a path separation strategy entirely
  - JMS: Davis did have a use case ...
  - (...details zip, consolidated brainstorming...)
  - JM: need both solutions...
